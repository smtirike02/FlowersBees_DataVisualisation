# DataVisualisation

## Exploring the Decline in Bees and Flower Density in England 

In this project, I will be exploring the decline in bees and flowers in England. The causes of the decline is happening for various reasons e.g. climate change. Flowers in abormal conditions are not able to bloom meaning that species like bees will not be able to pollinate causing biodiversity loss. My project will focus into the decline within the years of 2017 to 2020.

The outcome will consist of four posters consisting various ways of showing the data I've compiled. Graphs like bar charts, KDE plot, Facet plots and bubble chart were all included to show different ways of visualising the data.
